### Business Opportunity: 
Every year the music market changes and new trends appear that change how we listen to music. 
This project aims to analyze the major musical hits of the past 50 years to understand the influence of various factors on the popularity of songs, as well as their evolution. Using data extracted from the Spotify API and the Billboard API, we explore features such as energy, tempo, duration, and other attributes to understand their relationship with chart success.

### Initial Hypothesis: 
We believe that: 

- Music tracks have decreased their duration 
(probably due to the influence of TikTok and similar apps)
- Music has become more calm (tempo is slower).
- Nonetheless, music loudness hasn‚Äôt probably decreased
- Minor keys have become more frequent during the last years.
- The most common metric is 4/4 (by far).
- Music has become more repetitive during the last few years.
- There are more vindictive topics, specially related with feminism.

## Project Overview

### üìÅ Files Structure

The project is organized into the following key files and folders:

- `df....csv`: Saved data frames.  
- `main.py`: The main project file that runs the overall analysis, data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.
- `functions.py`: Contains helper functions to interact with the APIs, process data, and manipulate the results.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: This file describes the purpose of the project and how to run it.

### üîß Installation and Setup

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-user/your-project.git
cd your-project
```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Set up your Spotify and Billboard API keys. You need to create a .env file in the project root and add your credentials:

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
BILLBOARD_API_KEY=your_billboard_api_key
```

### üöÄ Running the Project

Run the main file: To begin the analysis and data extraction, execute the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): If you want to visualize graphs and explore the data, open the `eda.ipynb` notebook with Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook eda.ipynb
```

# üìä Analysis Description

- **Spotify API**: From this API, we obtained data related to song features, such as tempo, energy, duration, mode, and others.
- **Billboard API**: From this API, we extracted the historical rankings of the most popular songs, enabling a temporal analysis.
  
The analysis focused on understanding how these attributes and features change over time and their impact on popularity.

# üìà Results and Conclusions

The results obtained from the graphical and statistical analyses reveal several trends on how the characteristics of successful songs have changed over the past 50 years:

-

# üí° Initial Hypotheses

Before conducting the analysis, we started with the following hypotheses:

- Songs have become shorter in recent years (probably due to the influence of platforms like TikTok).
- Music has become calmer, with a slower tempo.
- However, the loudness of sound likely hasn‚Äôt decreased.
- Minor keys have become more common in recent years.
- The most common time signature remains 4/4 by a large margin.
- Music has tended to become more repetitive in recent years.
- Protest-related themes, especially those addressing feminism, are more common today.


# üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **Language**: Python
- **APIs**: Spotify, Billboard
- **Libraries**:
  - `requests`: For interacting with APIs
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn`: For data visualization
  - `dotenv`: To manage API credentials
  - `jupyter`: For exploratory analysis
